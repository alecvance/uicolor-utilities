# uicolor-utilities (extension to UIColor) for iOS development

Original Objective-C code by Erica Sadun.
More info at http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2009/02/iphone-development-accessing-uicolor-components.ars
Original repo was at github.com/ars/uicolor-utilities, but has since been taken down.

Was then reposted by user thetaplab to https://github.com/thetaplab/uicolor-utilities

Forked by Alec Vance, who added some new color mixing methods.

This works for iOS as-is. Can be used with SpriteKit on iOS and Mac by changing "UIColor" to "SKColor".
